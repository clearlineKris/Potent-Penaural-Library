## Introduction

Minnesota's cannabis regulatory landscape presents a unique jurisdictional complexity centered on tribal sovereignty. As the state develops its adult-use cannabis framework, Minnesota's eleven federally recognized tribes are asserting their inherent sovereign authority to regulate cannabis within their territories—independent of state oversight. This creates a distinctive multi-jurisdictional environment where state regulatory authority encounters the established boundaries of tribal self-governance.

## The "We Eat First" Assertion: Tribal Priority in Cannabis Opportunity

Minnesota tribes have articulated a powerful position regarding cannabis commerce: **"we eat first."** This assertion is not merely a claim to economic participation—it is a declaration of sovereign priority rooted in treaty rights, inherent tribal authority, and the hard-won recognition of tribal self-determination.

### Context and Significance

The phrase "we eat first" captures several interconnected principles:

1. **Sovereign Priority**: Tribes exercise their inherent governmental authority to regulate cannabis within Indian Country before and independent of state action. This is not a request for permission but an exercise of pre-existing sovereignty.

2. **Economic Self-Determination**: After centuries of economic marginalization and federal policies that systematically undermined tribal economies, tribes are asserting their right to be primary economic beneficiaries of cannabis opportunity within their jurisdictions.

3. **Rectifying Historical Injustice**: The cannabis industry represents one of the few emerging economic sectors where tribes can exercise market advantages through their sovereign regulatory authority. The "we eat first" position acknowledges that this opportunity comes after generations of exclusion from economic development.

4. **Territorial Jurisdiction**: Within tribal lands, the assertion means that tribal regulatory frameworks govern cannabis activity, not as a delegation from the state, but as an exercise of territorial sovereignty recognized under federal law.

## Regulatory Penumbra: Where Tribal and State Authority Meet

### The Ambiguous Boundaries

The intersection of tribal and state cannabis regulation in Minnesota reveals significant ambiguities:

- **Territorial Scope**: While Indian Country boundaries are legally defined, the practical application of competing regulatory jurisdictions creates uncertainty for businesses, consumers, and law enforcement.

- **Commerce Across Boundaries**: The movement of cannabis products between tribal lands and state-regulated territory presents unresolved questions about inspections, taxation, and licensing reciprocity.

- **Enforcement Coordination**: The respective roles of tribal police, state law enforcement, and federal authorities in addressing cannabis violations remain subject to interpretation and negotiation.

### Federal-Tribal-State Dynamics

The cannabis regulatory environment in Minnesota implicates three sovereigns:

1. **Federal Government**: While cannabis remains federally prohibited under the Controlled Substances Act, federal policy (through the Cole Memorandum framework and subsequent guidance) has generally allowed tribes to regulate cannabis, similar to state experimentation.

2. **Tribal Governments**: Exercise inherent sovereignty to regulate activities within Indian Country, backed by treaties, federal recognition, and Supreme Court precedent affirming tribal regulatory authority.

3. **State of Minnesota**: Has established its own cannabis regulatory framework but lacks direct regulatory authority over tribal lands.

## Stakeholder Asymmetry Analysis

### Power Dynamics and Information Gaps

The "we eat first" position highlights and partially addresses several asymmetries:

- **Historical Power Imbalance**: State governments have historically exercised disproportionate influence over tribal economic opportunities. Tribal cannabis sovereignty represents a partial reversal of this dynamic.

- **Economic Disparity**: Tribes face unique economic challenges. Cannabis represents a significant revenue opportunity that could fund essential governmental services, infrastructure, and social programs.

- **Regulatory Sophistication**: While some perceive tribes as having less regulatory capacity than states, many tribal governments have developed comprehensive regulatory frameworks demonstrating sophisticated governance capabilities.

- **Market Access**: Non-tribal cannabis businesses in Minnesota may face restrictions or requirements when operating near or in collaboration with tribal enterprises, creating uncertainty about competitive dynamics.

## Real-World Implications

### For Tribal Nations

- Ability to establish cannabis regulatory frameworks tailored to tribal values, public health priorities, and economic development goals
- Revenue generation for essential governmental services without state interference
- Assertion of territorial sovereignty as a precedent for other regulatory domains

### For State Regulators

- Need to respect tribal sovereignty while establishing state cannabis frameworks
- Developing protocols for inter-jurisdictional coordination without asserting inappropriate authority
- Managing public expectations about uniform regulation statewide when tribal lands operate under separate frameworks

### For Cannabis Businesses

- Navigation of multiple regulatory jurisdictions with potentially different rules
- Understanding that tribal sovereignty may limit market entry or require partnership structures
- Recognition that business models must respect "we eat first" priorities or face exclusion from certain markets

### For Consumers

- Access to tribal cannabis markets may be limited by tribal law (e.g., tribal member priority, on-reservation consumption only)
- Price and product availability differences between state and tribal markets
- Understanding that legal protections differ based on location of purchase and consumption

## Navigating the Ambiguity

### Key Considerations

1. **Respect Sovereign Boundaries**: Understand that tribal cannabis regulation is not subject to state approval or oversight. Engagement must occur government-to-government, respecting tribal authority.

2. **Anticipate Regulatory Diversity**: Minnesota will not have a uniform cannabis regulatory landscape. Tribal regulations may differ significantly from state frameworks in licensing, taxation, product standards, and market access.

3. **Monitor Inter-Jurisdictional Agreements**: Future compacts, memoranda of understanding, or coordination agreements between tribes and the state will define practical aspects of multi-jurisdictional operation.

4. **Recognize the "We Eat First" Principle**: Any business model, policy proposal, or regulatory framework that fails to acknowledge tribal priority in tribal territories is fundamentally misaligned with legal reality and principles of tribal sovereignty.

## Conclusion

Minnesota's cannabis regulatory environment is defined by a respectful recognition of tribal sovereignty and the rightful assertion by tribes that "we eat first." This is not merely a policy preference but a reflection of legal doctrine, historical context, and principles of self-determination. As Minnesota's cannabis landscape develops, the success of the overall framework depends on respecting these sovereign boundaries and recognizing that tribal priority is not an obstacle to navigate around, but a foundational principle of multi-jurisdictional governance.

The "we eat first" assertion is both a claim of priority and an invitation to understand cannabis regulation through the lens of tribal sovereignty—a lens that recognizes the rightful place of tribal governments as primary authorities within their territories and as communities that have earned the opportunity to realize economic benefits from this emerging industry.
