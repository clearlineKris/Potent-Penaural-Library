**Updated Guidance for Penumbrant Papers:**

The term "Penumbrant" refers to the **penumbra of cannabis law**—the gray areas, ambiguities, and unarticulated implications of cannabis regulations. The focus should be on legal shadows where the law is unclear, unwritten, or subject to interpretation.

**Key Focus Areas for Each Paper:**

1. **Ambiguities in Statutory Language** - Vague or undefined terms; differing interpretations
2. **Regulatory Gaps** - What the law doesn't address; emerging product categories
3. **Enforcement Discretion** - Inconsistent application; prosecutorial discretion
4. **Implied Rights and Restrictions** - What's permitted but not explicit
5. **Federal-State Tensions** - Constitutional penumbra from prohibition vs. legalization
6. **Local Control Variations** - Patchwork regulations creating additional gray areas
7. **Social Equity Ambiguities** - Unclear criteria and implementation
8. **Licensing and Market Structure** - Ownership, vertical integration uncertainties
9. **Case Law and Precedents** - How courts are filling gaps
10. **ORA Analysis** - How operator-regulator asymmetry is exacerbated by penumbral ambiguities
