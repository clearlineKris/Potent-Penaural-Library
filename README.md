# Potent-Penaural-Library

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of algorithms and utilities for audio processing, particularly focused on binaural audio effects and potency enhancements. The library is designed for easy integration into various audio applications.

## Recent Updates
- Added new binaural algorithm implementations:
  - Dynamic Delay
  - Frequency Modulation
- Updated existing algorithms to improve efficiency and reduce processing time.
- Improved documentation and example usage for all algorithms.

## Installation
To install the Potent-Penaural-Library, include the following in your project:

```
pip install potent-penaural-library
```

## Usage
Here are a few examples of how to use the library:

```python
from potent_penaural_library import BinauralEffect

# Create a new binaural effect instance
b_effect = BinauralEffect()

# Apply some effects
b_effect.apply_delay(0.5)
```
