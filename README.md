## About This Repository

**Penumbrant Papers** provide in-depth research on the "penumbra of cannabis law"—the gray areas, ambiguities, and unarticulated implications of cannabis regulations where the law is unclear, unwritten, or subject to interpretation.

**ORA Reports** examine Operator-Regulator Asymmetry, analyzing how regulatory ambiguity disproportionately affects cannabis operators and creates operational challenges.
